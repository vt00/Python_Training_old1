    "# Basic Python\n",
    "This is a tutorial of the basic elements of the python programming language. We'll discuss how to create and execute python files, review basic syntax and basic python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Python File\n",
    "A python file is simply a regular text file except it has the extension \".py\" typically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new text file and rename it **hello.py**. If you're working on Windows, be sure the filename isn't accidentally \"hello.py.txt\" as this is not actually a python file. In the example below, you will create the classic \"Hello World\" program.  \n",
    "To open the file, right click on it and click \"edit with IDLE.\" Then type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "and save the file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Executing a Python File\n",
    "There are two common ways of executing python files.\n",
    "1. Interactive mode (using and IDE)\n",
    "2. Batch Mode (Command Line)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Mode (with IDE)\n",
    "The IDE (Interactive Development Environment) we will use is called IDLE (a joke about Eric Idle and IDE). Once you open a file in IDLE, you can execute it by either clicking the run menu then clicking Run Module or you can use the shortcut key F5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The IDE has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to point and click. IDLE is not the only IDE you can use for python. However we're using it because it's simple, installed by default, and it's written in python. It's basically just a text editor with some additional features like syntax highlighting, tab completion, and the ability to execute python files directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Try running **hello.py** in IDLE by either clicking run>>Run Module or by typing F5. A new window will pop up and you should see this:"

    "The new window that popped up contains the **interactive shell**. It allows you to type python commands that are executed immediately. This is an incredibly powerful tool in python that you don't get with languages like C or Java.  \n",

   "source": [
    "We'll get into the details of the syntax shortly, but for now the important point is that the shell allows you to execute commands and get results immediately.  \n",
    "This is incredibly useful for debugging and testing out ideas. It speeds up the development process in a major way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember the difference between the text editor and the interactive shell.\n",
    "* The text editor allows you to write a series of instructions to be executed.\n",
    "* The interactive shell allows you to execute a single command and get immediate feedback \"interactively\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Mode (Command Line)\n",
    "The other main way to execute a python file is to batch it from the command line. Once you have a finished python file, this is typically how you would execute it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options when executing from the command line, but the basic command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python filename.py  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty simple. As the file executes, you'll see any print/logging statements appear in the terminal. If you open the command prompt (cmd.exe) where hello.py is saved and type python hello.py then you will see the message Hello World! printed to the console. It should execute very quickly since it's a simple program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll dive deeper into batch mode later. For now we'll mainly use IDLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "Python is known for clean, readable syntax. It makes writing code much easier and, more importantly, it also makes reading and understanding others' code much easier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python requires no semicolons to end a statement. A new line is sufficient. So, declaring a variable called \"a\" and setting it equal to 5 is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also declare with expressions like:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    a = 2+3  \n",
    "\n",
    "No need to end with semicolons. There's also no need to put everything in a main function or a Hello class, or a DATA step. Simply typing variables declarations into a file will do the job.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must start with a letter (not a number) and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. It can't include special characters like $. They can start with underscores but, aside from certain special cases, I would avoid doing this. Unlike SAS, variable names are case-sensitive so name isn't the same as Name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From a style standpoint, it's best to name python variables all lower case. Multi-word names separated with underscores. Not everyone follows this, but most do.  \n",
